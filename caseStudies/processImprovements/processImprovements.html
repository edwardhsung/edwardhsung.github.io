              While design thinking is used broadly for building products, it can be just as useful for guiding process improvements.
              When our team was asked to drive the conversation about delivering complex solutions to meet customer needs, we followed the principles of discover, define, develop, and deliver.

            <p>
              Zedi is delivering more complex solutions as our customers' needs become more sophisticated.
              As we scale, it takes more time to assess risk, small changes can bypass the workflow only to disrupt work later on, and knowledge silos prevent us from giving customers superior service.
              To meet these challenges, we initiated a program to update our processes.

              Changing an organization-wide process is a team effort.
              Our small core team first identified roles that would have a stake in the process.
              Stakeholder map in hand, we did some research.
              We pulled together representatives from nearly a dozen teams to explore and document the process in a visual way.

              </div>

              The team identified what was good, what was bad, and suggested improvements (using pink, blue, and green stickies, respectively).
              Given the size and diversity of the team, it was vital to have them capture their ideas right on the diagram.
              Not only did it give context but it also allowed us to carry the momentum through mutiple sessions.

            <p>
              Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, we kept the team moving by asking them to choose 2 workflows to improve for our first iteration.
              They chose to explore requirements gathering and feature delivery.
              While tempting to just start building the new workflows, we gave them time to first articulate success in a way that others could understand.
            </p>

              <img width="60%" src="./images/whatDoesSuccessLookLike.png" alt="What does success look like?" />
            </div>
            <p>
              They wanted things like "clean hand-offs", "zero customer disputes on invoices", "all teams have the same understanding of customer expectations".
              We grouped all the responses and created themes that embodied the sentiment from each grouping.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center standard-padding">

            </div>
            </p>
              And these three themes led to three objectives we would use to measure success for our new workflow.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Meet customer delivery expectations.</li>
              <li>Increase alignment between teams.</li>
              <li>Reduce employee frustration.</li>

            <h2 class="title">Develop</h2>
            <p>
              Having defined our themes, we went to work describing ideal workflows that encapsulated requirements gathering and/or feature delivery.
              Rather than jumping straight to prototyping, we took a page from the Design Sprint playbook and employed the "sticky decision" to help the team form and express opinions without lengthy debate, understand and critique ideas, and choose a standout workflow.

              <div class="row text-center standard-padding">
                <div class="column">
                  <img width="80%" src="./images/stickyDecision-resize.png" alt="Sticky Decision" /><br>
                  <figcapture class="caption">The sticky decision required the team to pick one solution to explore further.</figcapture>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <img width="80%" src="./images/storyboarding.png" alt="Storyboarding" /><br>
                  <figcapture class="caption">Storyboard outlining the steps for a Project Manager to take a project from binding agreement to delivery.</figcapture>
                </div>
                <br>
              </div>

              While basic, our storyboard allowed the team to describe and record details which led to specific improvements.
              Storyboard complete, we created hypotheses in the form of "if we do x...we expect y...and we will know by measuring z".
              Hypotheses help us know what we're trying to solve and how to measure that we are right.
              When dealing with a process, which is more abstract than a product, it's even more important to have clear objectives and measures.

              <div class="text-center standard-padding">
                <img width="70%" src="./images/wordArtIfWeDoExpectMeasure.png" alt="If we do x...we expect y...and we will know by measuring z" />
              </div>

              We came up with several hypotheses based on the problems to solve and proposed solutions.
              In the example below, we made sure each hypothesis tied into a workflow step with a clear idea of what we were trying to measure.
            </p>

              <figcapture class="caption">We used the storyboard to highlight recommendations. We stated these recommendations in hypotheses which clearly state the recommendation and our expectations if we implement the recommendation.</figcapture>

            <p>
              We chose to use a Process Map to describe the hypotheses, making it easy for the team to reference.
              <i>If you're curious about why we chose a process map instead of a flowchart or other tool, you can wait for the future case study or contact me for details.</i>

            <p>
              Before rolling it out en masse, we ran user testing to validate it in a controlled environment.
              By chosing a real-life project, we could see if we captured the nuances of bringing an opportunity from sales team to delivery.
              By running it in a controlled environment, we could get our results in hours, not days or weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We chose users who were going to be using the process on a regular basis.  And we asked each participant to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify their responsibilities.</li>
              <li>Complete their tasks.</li>
              <li>Upon completion of all the tasks in a phase, we moved to the next phase, talking though the hand-off as required.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>
              We recorded how well they understood their role and how useful each deliverable was to the workflow.
              During testing we validated several recommendations, made adjustments to some, and flagged one recommendation for more exploration.

              One does not change process simply by posting it to a document repository and hoping that people will use it.
              To increase our chance for success we have secured leadership support and are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Getting some quick wins by introducing some of the simpler recommendations and measuring them.</li>
              <li>Providing training.</li>
              <li>Encouraging the teams to take ownership of the process by having them create team-specific plans for creating the process deliverables.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>An experience diagram is a great way to describe a process without getting bogged down with too much detail.</li>
                <li>Pick one or two key parts of the process (with maybe 5-7 steps) to work on.  It will keep the team focused and provide the "small win" necessary to keep the momentum going.</li>
                <li>User testing a process is just as important as testing a product.  We were able to identify missing deliverables and communication gaps as we observed the interactions during our test session that would often be overlooked in the real world.</li>
                <li>Hypotheses are essential if you want to clearly articulate what success looks like to the organization.</li>

              Introducing people to design thinking tools and mindsets opened the door for follow-up conversations about how design thinking applies to their day-to-day lives.
              Even more exciting was the opportunity for us to infuse design into the process we were changing.
              In this iteration we are improving our requirements gathering by including design thinking techniques.
              Research is being done prior to the backlog rather than after development begins.
              And with our next iteration we are leveraging product analytics to better measure user behaviour.
