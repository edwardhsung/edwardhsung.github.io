            <p>
              Annual reports get a bad rap.  Ask most people, and the first thing they'll think about is numbers and walls of text.  Yawn.
              I don't disagree, many reports can be pretty dry.  They convey the bare essentials to shareholders and not much more.
              But I do believe we can do better.  I want to help others make an impact.
              And I count the annual report as one tool that I have to do that.
              Not just only for facts and figures, but we also explain why we do what we do.

              <p>
                Great organizations have great stories to tell.
                Our annual reports provide a focal point for telling us where we are and how we got there.
                It transforms our snapshot in time into a journey.
                Those who experienced it can savour the moments all over again.
                Those who didn't can still get a taste of the challenges and celebrations.

                Instead of just telling the story, let's tell about how each piece contributed to the whole.
                By listing our main goals, we give you a clear idea of what our organization is about.
                Iconography then helps you to link each event/program to the underlying principles.

                How can you get involved?  While the word "report" tends to invoke the idea of looking back, it can also be a potent way to engage people.
                While describing the various parts of the organization, we also highlight how you can be a part of it and help us write the stories for the future.
                We provide clear direction for different levels of commitment and experience.

              <p>
                Not only can an annual report help us celebrate the past and drive people in the present.
                It can be an excellent tool for describing the future.
                In addition to having a call to action for the previous year, I find it helpful to create an annual report at the start of the coming year.
              </p>
              <p>
                This idealized "report" contains items that I would like to see happen in the coming year(s).
                This exercise serves a few practical purposes:
                <ul>
                  <li>It provides a framework for planning.</li>
                  <li>It gives you talking points to rally the team and can be the source of your "vision drip" throughout the year.</li>
                  <li>It's a metric you can use to track your progress.</li>
                </ul>
