              Zedi has been around for over 20 years and is a well established brand in its market.
              Our brand is backed by hardware and software field solutions, a platform, and website to tie them all together.
              Over that time, our customers have relied on us to provide accurate and timely information both in the field and in the office.

              Customers expect to have their data wherever they are.
              And they want to be able to have control of their field devices at their fingertips.
              Our mobile app makes that possible.

              Our platform has been 20 years in the making and provides a reliable starting point for our newest product, ZediGo.
              ZediGo provides a fresh mobile experience that is intuitive for our web users and leverages the power our existing systems.

            <p>
              Building on a 20 year old platform presents certain challenges.
              You often run into decisions that were "a good idea at the time".
              Sometimes you're lucky and they continue to be good ideas.
              Other times, you find that you've outgrown those old models.
              For those occasions, we are using the strangler fig approach.
              Instead of a large rewrites, we gradually implement portions of the new system by replacing small sections of the old one.

            <p>
              A good product begins with a good story.
              Our team began by spending time learning about our customers.
              We examined how they used our website, learned which information was important to them and which could be streamlined.
              We followed them into the field and took note of what they put into their logbooks.
              We asked them about their joys and frustrations.

            <h2 class="title">New Tech, New Team</h2>
            <p>
              Lean Startup anyone?  We began the project with a relatively small team, just a dev or two and some part time help from the business side.
              We settled on using react-native and graphql, brand new stuff for those of us used to the server side of .net and not quite so new for those of us used to the client-side js frameworks circa the early 2010s.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we iterated through our stories, our success led to new features, more requirements.  And as our backlog grew, so did the team.
              Initally, the picture was a bit bleak as the team shrunk to a single dev.
              But help was on the way, and we quadrupled in size by adding resources from both inside and outside the company.
              Onboarding new hires and training them in new tech, while keeping an eye on how to integrate with the legacy systems, was a struggle.
              But we were able to make it through.

              Our current production iteration provides users with the ability to:

                <li>Get the latest data from their remote locations</li>
                <li>Enter data while they are offline</li>
                <li>Sync that data to the platform when they are back online</li>

              From a corporate perspective, ZediGo has helped Zedi to stay at the top of its game.
              Customers are excited to be able to leave their laptops and logbooks behind while they go on site with their phones.
              And our sales people are delighted to have a new tool in their kit to provide customer value.

            <h2 class="title">The App as an Agent of Change</h2>
            <p>
              One of the challenges of legacy systems is to know when to keep building on the legacy foundation and when to refactor.
              We have found that it's tough to justify any infrastructure work unless there is a clear business value associated with it.
              Having the app has given us a chance to make a case for updating our platform.
              There is a lot of overlap between the use cases for the website and the mobile app and it makes sense to make the code work with both.
              And while you've cracked open code that hasn't been touched for 5 years, you might as well start adding tests and making improvements.
              To be honest, we haven't renovated vast swathes of the legacy code; and perhaps that's the stuff of dreams.
              But we're certainly leaving the codebase a better place than when we started.
